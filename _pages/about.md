I am an assistant professor (RtdA) at the Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry, University of Padua (Italy).

I received the Bachelor degree (2011) and the Master degree (2014) from the University of Padova, both in Civil Engineering. I then pursued the Doctoral degree in Land, Environment, Resources, and Health from the University of Padua, Italy (2018).

My PhD thesis was focused on the development and test of a hydrological model with the aim of predicting the triggering of stony debris flows in the Dolomites (Northeastern Italian Alps).

After the PhD, I collaborated as postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry at the University of Padua, working on the monitoring and modeling of stony debris flows in the Dolomites. Since March 2023, I am holding the current position, within the “RETURN - multi-Risk sciEnce for resilienT commUnities undeR a changiNg climate” project, MUR-PNRR Extended Partnership PE3, funded by Next-Generation EU.
